 Component for handling MechComp-signals
 Add this component to any object if you'd like it to send and or receive MechComp-messages (often called signals)
 There are are three "setup" COMSIGs you may want, and a few transmission COMSIGs.

      ------  SETUP COMSIGS  ------
 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_ADD_INPUT, display_name, proc_name
    Registers a custom input for your device. When connecting devices, the user can select "display_name" as an input.
    Your device will need an associated proc/proc_name that handles receiving messages.
    If your device is purely a sensor, it does not need any inputs.

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_ADD_CONFIG, display_name, proc_name
    Registers a custom configuration for your device. It is similar to  COMSIG_MECHCOMP_ADD_INPUT.

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_ALLOW_MANUAL_SIGNAL
    Adds the "Set Send-Signal" config-option to your device.
    Use this with COMSIG_MECHCOMP_TRANSMIT_DEFAULT_MSG detailed below

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_RM_ALL_CONNECTIONS
    Removes all MechComp connections to and from the device.
    This is the "Disconnect All" config-option, but you may want to call it after certain events,
    such as unwelding a sensor-pipe in a loafer, or deconstructing a vending machine.
    As a game-balance rule: devices should break connections when they move / are picked up.


      ------  TRANSMISSION COMSIGS  ------
 A note on MechComp messages:
/Please try to always re-use incoming signals for your outgoing signals.
/Just modify the message of the incoming signal and send it along.
/This is important because each message keeps track of which nodes it traveled trough.
/It's through that list that we can prevent infinite loops. Or at least try to.
/(People can probably still create infinite loops somehow. They always manage)

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_TRANSMIT_SIGNAL, signal_data, file
    Creates a new message containing the signal_data and optional file. Fires this message to all connected outputs.
    Use this for sensors and other devices that can create messages without having received one.

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_TRANSMIT_DEFAULT_MSG, reusable_msg
    Transmits the stored signal from COMSIG_MECHCOMP_ALLOW_MANUAL_SIGNAL.
    If a reusable_msg is passed in, it will be reused, otherwise a fresh message will be created.

 COMSIG_MECHCOMP_TRANSMIT_MSG, msg
    Transmits the msg to all connected outputs. Does not modify the signal of msg.
