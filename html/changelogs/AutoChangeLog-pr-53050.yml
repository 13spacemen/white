changes: 
  - tweak: "Gripper glove tackles now disable throw mode when you hit something (whether it's a person, a window, or whatever)"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer suffer head wounds from bad rolls on tackling other people, but you can if you hit an object/wall"
  - balance: "Tackling solid objects/walls is now slightly less prone to maim you"
